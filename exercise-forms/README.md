# Welcome to exercise - Forms

In this exercise were going to work with Angular forms

- ...


## Notice ⚠️

- exercise might be broken when you start it (errors in console) but this should fix itself as you progress through implementation of // TODO items


## How to start

- try searching for numbered `// TODO` code comments in the `projects` folder or use TODO functionality of your editor 


## How to use exercises

- every exercise folder should be installed using `npm ci`
- every exercise can be started using `npm start` to run the app
- every exercise can start tests in watch mode using `npm run watch`
- every exercise has it's own `README.md` file with additional description of the given exercise
- every exercise project contains ordered `TODO ` in the readme and `// TODO` comments inside of the source code (eg `// TODO 2: description`) which should be followed to complete the given exercise
- you can always search for `// TODO`, or `<!-- TODO` or check `README.md` for the next TODO item
