# Welcome to Exercise #3 - Basic Angular

In this exercise were going to explore creation of components & services

- Create component
- Render data
- Use various built in directives
- Create more components and implement inter component communication 
- Create and use service

## TODO 0: Start application
Make sure your application is running by executing `npm start`

## TODO 1: Create CustomerItemComponent
1. Use `ng g c features/customers/customer-item` to generate new component, it will automatically be added to the `declarations: [ ]` of `CustomersModule`...


## How to start

- try searching for numbered `TODO` readme items and `// TODO` code comments in the `projects` folder or use TODO functionality of your editor 

## How to use exercises

- every exercise folder should be installed using `npm ci`
- every exercise can be started using `npm start` to run the app
- every exercise can start tests in watch mode using `npm run watch`
- every exercise has it's own `README.md` file with additional description of the given exercise
- every exercise project contains ordered `TODO ` in the readme and `// TODO` comments inside of the source code (eg `// TODO 2: description`) which should be followed to complete the given exercise
- you can always search for `// TODO`, or `<!-- TODO` or check `README.md` for the next TODO item
